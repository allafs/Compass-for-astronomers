# Compass-for-astronomers
Elaboration of a compass with information necessary for the alignment and leveling of telescopes and assemblies.

It is a compass designed to help astronomers and astrophotographers in aligning their equipment, especially in places without Internet access.
It was built using an Arduino Nano and a compass module with accelerometer.
The firmware was developed on the Arduino IDE.
The parts of the box have been 3D printed.
Future changes are planned, including:
1- Exchange the Arduino Nano for the Esp32;
2- Include information from a GPS;
3- Change the LCD screen for an OLED;
4- Add to the Menu the Local Sidereal Time, the local coordinates, the local time, the local height, the local temperature and humidity data and the geographic coordinates;
5- Provide a small database of astronomical object coordinates;
6- Send commands to GOTO via Bluetooth using LX200 protocol.

Contributions are welcome.
