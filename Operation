Operating is easy.

1) When turning on the equipment, it will calibrate the LSM303 D automatically.

2) The menu indicates the magnetic compass.
You can navigate to other functions using the left and right buttons.
But the first thing to do is level the telescope tripod.
To do this, mount the tripod, with one leg facing north if you are in the northern hemisphere 
of the planet or to the south if you are in the southern hemisphere. 
Navigate the menu to "Leveling" and press the center button.
The indicator shows the values that must be zero for the base to be level.

3) After leveling, press the central button to stop the reading and navigate with the side buttons to “Compass Magn” and press the central button again for reading.
Locate the north. Use the pointer to mark geographic north according to your location on the planet.
Point the telescope to the geographic north or south, depending on which hemisphere you are in.

4) If you want to know the vertical inclination of the observed object, just access the "Inclination" menu,
activate the reading and position the equipment base on the telescope body.

Finally, I put a scale in centimeters, next to the equipment, if you want to use it in a geographic location map.
